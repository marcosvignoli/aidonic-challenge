## Workspace Management

This project uses npm Workspaces for monorepo management:

- **Package linking**: Workspaces automatically link packages together
- **Dependency hoisting**: Common dependencies are hoisted to the root
- **Cross-workspace scripts**: Run commands across all workspaces
- **Selective execution**: Target specific workspaces when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Mobile Development Issues

#### Port 8081 Already in Use
```bash
# Kill existing Metro processes
pkill -f "react-native start"

# Restart Metro with cache reset
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### Missing @babel/runtime Error
```bash
# Ensure @babel/runtime is in dependencies (not devDependencies)
# Check apps/mobile/package.json and move if needed
npm install
```

#### Metro Dependency Resolution Issues
```bash
# The mobile app's metro.config.js is configured for monorepo
# It includes watchFolders and nodeModulesPaths to resolve dependencies
# from the root node_modules directory
```

#### CocoaPods Issues
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx pod-install
```

#### Metro Server Issues
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### iOS Build Issues
```bash
cd apps/mobile/ios
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

#### Watchman Warnings
```bash
# Clear Watchman cache
watchman watch-del '/Users/marcosvignoli/Code/aidonic-challenge' ; watchman watch-project '/Users/marcosvignoli/Code/aidonic-challenge'
```

### Web Development Issues

#### Next.js Build Issues
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

#### TypeScript Issues
```bash
# Check types across all packages
npm run check-types --workspaces
```

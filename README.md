# Aidonic Challenge - Aid Distribution Dashboard

A comprehensive Aid Distribution Dashboard with both Web (Next.js) and Mobile (React Native) interfaces, built using modern development practices and architectural patterns.

## üöÄ My Development Journey

On this project, my first step was getting familiarized with the architectural requests of the SOLID principles and the container/presentation patterns.

After learning about it, I realized that I needed to implement a monorepo to make this work. Probably I could just do two separated projects, but this would mean writing a bunch of duplicated code. So I started learning about it too, since even though I've worked with yarn workspaces before, I had never set up a monorepo myself.

At the beginning, I went with Turborepo, but after facing a bunch of issues with the setup, I switched to npm workspaces since it was easier to set up in my findings.

Once I addressed a few version challenges, most of all from the side of React Native, specifically with the React Native Navigation library and React 19 support, I got two working apps, both Next.js and React Native.

After that initial setup, I started with the creation of rules and a scrum plan with Cursor to get every feature implemented in a gradual way, so I could test and improve the code on each EPIC. I also established the requirements and development standards so the code needed small fixes from my side.

I've been impressed about how much code could be shared between apps with the container/presentation pattern, and so I would probably implement this on my own projects.

I feel like the biggest challenge that I found was thinking about what could be shared and what should remain native for each platform, and the whole setup itself. The code side of things didn't feel like a challenge since the UI was quite simple.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Mobile Development Issues

#### Port 8081 Already in Use
```bash
# Kill existing Metro processes
pkill -f "react-native start"

# Restart Metro with cache reset
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### Metro Dependency Resolution Issues
```bash
# The mobile app's metro.config.js is configured for monorepo
# It includes watchFolders and nodeModulesPaths to resolve dependencies
# from the root node_modules directory
```

#### CocoaPods Issues
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx pod-install
```

#### iOS Build Issues
```bash
cd apps/mobile/ios
pod install
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Web Development Issues

#### Next.js Build Issues
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build
```

#### TypeScript Issues
```bash
# Check types across all packages
npm run check-types --workspaces
```
